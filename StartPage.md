_"Of course,"_ she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is a **little moxie**!"
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

I read this interesting quote the other day:
> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"
> _He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity.Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying.He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

## Exercise 2
##### DocBook
* DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation. It was back in the days intended for writing technical documents
related to computer hardware and software, but these days you can use it any sort of documentation.
* When a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats, rather than needing to be rewritten.
  * Because DocBook is XML, documents can be created and edited with any text editor.

##### SCRIPT (markup)
* SCRIPT is a procedural markup language. Inline commands called control words, indicated by a period in the first column of a logical line, describe the desired appearance of the formatted text.
* Script includes a facility for user-defined macros and for automatically reading a profile containing macro definitions and other commands. Several packages for semantic tagging, including GML and EasyScript, are built on top of this facility.

##### TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
* The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a text-centric community of practice in the academic field of digital humanities, operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains the TEI technical standard, a journal,[1] a wiki, a GitHub repository and a toolchain. 
* The TEI Guidelines collectively define a type of XML format, and are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known open formats for text (such as HTML and OpenDocument) in that it is primarily semantic rather than presentational
